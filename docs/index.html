<h1>GaleForceCore</h1>

<p>This library has many helpers, builders, parsers, and other common utilities and methods that are often used by many projects.</p>

<h2>SimpleSqlBuilder</h2>

<p>SimpleSqlBuilder uses expression-based LINQ-like methods to build SQL (Server) commands, as well as equally execute against test data. The benefit of this approach is gaining the speed of direct commands, but with the compile-time, testability associated with Entity Framework. Combined with the GaleForce.SQL library, you can execute against SQL Server with the exact same code as testing, and leverage other functionality including bulk copying, simply by adding UseBulkCopy().</p>
